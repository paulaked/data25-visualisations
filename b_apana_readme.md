# data25-visualisations

Task: 
- Create your own branch for this repo and commit & push your work to it frequently with good commit messages.
- Change this README.md to your own version on your branch, outlining what dataset you are using and notes about your data exploration/analysis.
- Pick a dataset from Kaggle, if you struggle pick one of the suggested ones below. 
- Clean and analyse the dataset using Pandas DataFrames and packages like seaborn and matplotlib to create visualisations.

## Example Datasets from Kaggle:

- Kickstarter projects: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects?select=ks-projects-201801.csv
csv file, contains information about successful and failed kickstarter projects.
- Google Play Store Apps: https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps
2 csv files - one contains information about the apps, the other contains user reviews. Possible to analyse single file, but gives room for joining and deeper analysis.
- Videogame Sales: https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales
csv file, contains information about videogames and sales in 4 different regions
- Book Review Ratings: https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/bookcrossing-dataset
3 csv files - information about books, users, and ratings.

## Bart Apanasionok Project Notes
I selected the "Top Spotify songs from 2010-2019 - BY YEAR" data set available  at:
https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year

my first thought is to analyse the data by metrics such as genre and see if there 
are any patterns over time.

End of day monday 6th december
I have imported the csv into pycharm and created a dataframe
I have created further data frames for each year 

plan is to do candle stick plot of bpm, energy, dance, db live ect
for each year
I also want to look at each artist ect

duration may be of particular interest, I think there is an 
article about how song duration has reduced due to how
the spotify algorithms work.
