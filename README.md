Task: 
- Create your own branch for this repo and commit & push your work to it frequently with good commit messages.
- Change this README.md to your own version on your branch, outlining what dataset you are using and notes about your data exploration/analysis.
- Pick a dataset from Kaggle, if you struggle pick one of the suggested ones below. 
- Clean and analyse the dataset using Pandas DataFrames and packages like seaborn and matplotlib to create visualisations.

## My project

I am going to be using the Kickstarter dataset from Kaggle (Kickstarter projects: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects?select=ks-projects-201801.csv csv file)

- I have removed the 'usd pledged' column which had 3797 NaN values, and the 4 rows where the name was null

- I am going to check for duplicate data and hopefully merge if applicable
